The dc-utilities package contains functions that I use in most of my programs.

There are filesystem functions, such as create-directory, directory-exists, file-exists, file-extension, file-line-count, filter-file, spew, freeze-n-spew, slurp, and slurp-n-thaw.  

There are data structure functions, all starting with the prefix 'ds-', for dealing with nested data structures.

There's a group of functions for creating and managing thread pools.

And, finally, there's a fairly long list of functions (and macros) that do all sorts of other things, like shell-execute, uint-to-bytes, verify-string, and with-lines-in-file.
